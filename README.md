ü§ù Contribute
------------
All kinds of contributions are welcome. E.g.:

- Submitting feedback
- Fixing bugs
- Or implementing a new feature.

Some opportunities for improvement:
- [ ] Making the spaghetti code nice, clean and more efficient. (unfortunately I'm not a coder but I know that there are many opportunities for improvement)
- [ ] Switching from Beautifulsoup to [lxml](https://lxml.de/). lxml is faster as it is implemented in C
- [ ] Adding more features from multitran.com (e.g. search for phrases)
